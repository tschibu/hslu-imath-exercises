## Install Octave kernel for Jupyter

### macOS

1. Create virtual env using conda or other similar tools  

2. Install [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) and [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html)

```bash
brew install octave
brew install gnuplot
```

3. Install octave kernel

```bash
pip install octave_kernel
```

4. Check if the kernel is available

```bash
$ jupyter kernelspec list
Available kernels:
  octave     /Users/user/Library/Jupyter/kernels/octave
  python3    /Users/user/Applications/anaconda3/envs/imath/share/jupyter/kernels/python3
```

5. Start Jupyther

`jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`, if available

`In the notebook interface, select Octave from the 'New' menu`
